This code has now been made into an R package and is deprecated. See here: https://github.com/benjaminfrot/lrpsadmm

An (accelerated) Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) implementation of the low-rank plus sparse estimator.

See here for a tutorial: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/benjaminfrot/lrps-admm/blob/master/LRpSADMMExample.ipynb

This code will soon be made into an R package. 

We implement the estimator described in: https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.aos/1351602527 .

This R implementation uses an accelerated version with restarts of the ADMM algortihm, as described in: ftp://ftp.math.ucla.edu/pub/camreport/cam12-35.pdf .
